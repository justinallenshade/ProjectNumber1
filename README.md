## probblems and hurdles <br/>
The main problem I had to overcome and will still rarely effect my
 code is that the keyframes and animations don't alwyas behave as intended. 
 The animations will sometimes freeze on there own but by running through it again it actually stops them from occuring. 
 The other major contributing factor that led to the catching of the animations was if the animation plays out in under a second. 
 For some odd reson, the lower the time is, the more the animations mess up.
